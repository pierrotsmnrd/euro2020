# Context & Warnings

I coded this Panel app in a rush during the championship.

I made this on my spare time, and **I traded quality for speed**.

At first, I published the website but not the repo, because I wanted to do some cleanup before that. 
In the end I never took the time to cleanup, and people started to ask for the code, to understand how I achieved some tricks here and there.

So I just decided to make this repo public - but please, no comment on the quality ok ? :) 
I've done much cleaner and better in other project. 

Still, I'm happy with a few things : 
- By default, flags emojis don't render on Windows. I had to find a trick to use a custom font to render them.
- Switch between french and english versions with a simple dropdown.
- Good demonstrator of what Panel can do.
